# Conclusions: 
# Hypothesis 1 (that living mother and gender interact to predict family 
# interference on work) was not supported. The coefficient estimate for the interaction 
# term, living_mother x gender, in the ANOVA model was not significant (p = .738).
# Hypothesis 2 (that those who donâ€™t know if their mother is alive or not have greater 
# family interference on work than those who do while controlling for admin_month) was also
# not supported. The p-value for the estimated difference in marginal means for both males 
# (p = .815) and females (p = .281) in the planned contrast analysis was greater than .05.
