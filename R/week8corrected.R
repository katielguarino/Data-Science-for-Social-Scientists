# Conclusions: 
# Hypothesis 1 (that living mother and gender interact to predict family 
# interference on work) was not supported. The test of the interaction term, 
# living_mother x gender, in the ANOVA model was not significant (F = .304, p = .738).

# Hypothesis 2 (that those who donâ€™t know if their mother is alive or not have greater 
# family interference on work than those who do while controlling for admin_month) was also
# not supported. The estimated difference in marginal means in the planned contrast analysis
# was not significant (t = .908, p = .363).
